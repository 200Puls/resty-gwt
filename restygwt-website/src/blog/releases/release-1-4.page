The [RestyGWT Team](http://restygwt.fusesource.org) is pleased to announce
the release of RestyGWT 1.4. RestyGWT is a
[GWT](http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/) generator for REST services and a
Jackson style object to JSON encoder/decoder. It makes accessing REST based
JSON services as easy to access as GWT RPC style services.

Release Highlights:

* cherry picked commit 569b812 of PR #149 and adjusted mock-testcase
* fix #156
* fix naming for inner classes #158
* get more test working or clearly comment out tests in suite
* use rails3-maven-plugin which works with maven-3.1.x as well
* allow Attribute annotation expression to return null value
* getters and setters do not need a matching field. @JsonIgnore works on fields or the setter or the getter
* encode/decode nested arrays, lists, sets and maps as fields or property of a pojo
* move all GWT.lo to java.util.logging.Logger
* send enum null values as null when defined as pojo field #154
* adjusted contribution part and issue tracker to be in line with how we are doing it
* make the URLencode working with null values as well
* reduce noise during test run
* white spaces
* url encode PathParam -  issue #147
* Fix typos, improve consistency
* some white space changes
* Refactor the getPossibleType method in JsonEncoderDecoderClassCreator. I created a kind of JsonTypeInfo.Id visitor that can be reused for other matters. I extracted the code from the JsonEncoderDecoderClassCreator to put it in the visitor.
* Split the HUGE generate method into different methods.
* Fix Eclipse web.xml validation
* Support default value for @JsonTypeInfo property
* Revert "Default @JsonTypeInfo Id.CLASS property value"
* Revert "Add support for JsonDeserialize for interfaces"
* Add support for JsonDeserialize for interfaces
* Default @JsonTypeInfo Id.CLASS property value
* fixed mapping for @JsonTypeInfo - MINIMAL_CLASS (. as prefix); added support for discovering all subtypes of generic type during the generation process, thus no need to use the @JsonSubTypes annotation in combination with @JsonTypeInfo - CLASS or MINIMAL_CLASS
* added a note on hwo to parse jsonString and about JsonProperty to customize names
* added test case for decoding/encoding nested Maps
* tests for methods returning Request or JsonpRequest
* let RestService interface methods return either JsonpRequest or Request
* Fixed 204 not handled roperly for MSIE 8 and 9
* allow getters and setters corresponding field
* added generic list encoder - start to nest collection
* Reduced loglevel for type encoder information to debug
* Fixed a bug in serializing lists and arrays using @FormParams.
* some jsonp test
* make the resource creation lazy inside restService impl - #114
* Support FormParams. Fixes issue #92.
* fix encoding of BigDecimal keys of maps (#111)
* fixed issue with short decoding, cast requred (#106)
* parse strings of generic map keys correctly
* let jsonp handle list of POJOs correctly
* let rest-service use default dispatcher from Defaults when none is set on interface
* Take dispatcher from Defaults if local one for the Method is not set.
* get the generated ode compile
* added missing annotation
* discriminate Lists on JSONP results
* Revert "discriminate JSONArray on JSONP results"
* discriminate JSONArray on JSONP results
* fixed #108 - allow to ignore any fields in the classhierachy
* fixed map decode with complex and number keys
* Documented DirectRestService usage in the user documentation.
* added test for QueryParam
* add test case for @PathParams
* remove yellow flag from eclipse
* fix regression issue #102 : but expression insde brackets to allow further arithemitek to keep expression as is.
